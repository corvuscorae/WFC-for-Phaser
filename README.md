issues:
- TODO: scene slows down when "Go" is clicked several times. Likely mem leak -- FIND AND FIX

next:
- add map tiles
- decorations?
- r-key regeneration?
- context-sensitive generation?
- visualization of generation approach? [<- this is only partially done so far]
- improved map coherence?
- [not for credit but would be nice] learning functionality
