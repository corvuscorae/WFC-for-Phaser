issues:
[] TODO: scene slows down when "Go" is clicked several times. Likely mem leak -- FIND AND FIX
[] TODO: need to fix rotate() in Tile.js

next:
[] add map tiles
[] decorations?
[] r-key regeneration?
[] context-sensitive generation?
[] visualization of generation approach? [<- this is only partially done so far]
[] improved map coherence?
[] [not for credit but would be nice] learning functionality
